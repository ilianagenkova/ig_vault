1. hsi  (hit Enter): get on HPSS and make a directory for youself in 1year, 2year or 5year directories
2. send a few tar files instead of many small files (don't skip the ":")

   hsi put 4cactus.tar : /NCEPDEV/emc-da/5year/Iliana.Genkova/OBSPROC/Venus/4cactus.tar

3. Need to run one more command to creat index *idx file:

   htar -Xvf  /NCEPDEV/emc-da/5year/Ashley.Stanfield/MarineArchive/2022.tar  (the X is capital!!!)
 
This command will create *.idx files for each *tar file, and would allow the users to extract only sections of the big tar files, for example -
htar -xvf /NCEPPROD/..../filename.tar     ./path2single_file/single_file_name
